"""`k8s_demo_flow.py`'s overlay wiring and the forgery it publishes. eventing-lab#2.

The stages themselves need a cluster, but three things that decide whether the demo
proves anything do not — and one of them was silently wrong before this:

  * which overlay runs in mock mode (`self.mock`)
  * which overlay runs the signed beats (`self.signed_beats`)
  * whether the forged event the demo publishes is the event the consumer refuses

The third is the one worth a test rather than a comment. A forgery that is malformed
would be refused for the wrong reason — `from_kafka_binary` would simply fail to decode
it — and the demo would appear to pass while proving nothing about the signature check.
