# eventing-lab — Design specs

A spec is a **deep dive on one subsystem or one slice of work**: what we are building, why,
what we considered and turned down, and what we are knowingly deferring. It is the document
you read before changing the thing it describes.

**This file is the registry.** It is the source of truth for milestone ids and status; the
filenames are dated and descriptive so they never need renaming when numbering shifts.

## Index

This work is phase-structured, so the ID is the phase. Each phase is a **delta over the one
before it** — read them in order; only Phase 0 is self-contained.

| ID      | Title                                            | Spec                                                                                       | Status                       | Report                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 0 | Local signed-event wake demo (no Kubernetes)     | [`0001-phase0-local-wire-contract.md`](0001-phase0-local-wire-contract.md)                 | Implemented                  | [`phase0-report.md`](../reports/phase0-report.md)                         |
| Phase 1 | KEDA-scaled Kubernetes deployment                | [`0002-phase1-keda-kubernetes.md`](0002-phase1-keda-kubernetes.md)                         | Implemented                  | [`phase1-report.md`](../reports/phase1-report.md)                         |
| Phase 2 | Identity on the event path                       | [`0003-phase2-identity-on-the-event-path.md`](0003-phase2-identity-on-the-event-path.md)   | Implemented — partial        | [`phase2-cluster-run-report.md`](../reports/phase2-cluster-run-report.md) |
| Phase 3 | Per-user isolation, declarative agents, triggers | [`0004-phase3-tenancy-agents-triggers.md`](0004-phase3-tenancy-agents-triggers.md)         | Accepted — partly implemented | [`phase3-report.md`](../reports/phase3-report.md)                         |
| Phase 4 | Enrollment, and asking a human for permission    | [`0005-phase4-enrollment-and-permission.md`](0005-phase4-enrollment-and-permission.md)     | Proposed — design only        | —                                                                         |
| Demo 3P | The three-part ykt1 demo (presentation only)      | [`2026-11-05-three-part-demo-design.md`](2026-11-05-three-part-demo-design.md)             | Accepted — partly implemented | —                                                                         |

**Demo 3P is not a phase** and adds no capability — it is the presentation layer over Phases 1
and 2, kept here because it is a design with rejected alternatives rather than a runbook. The
runbook it produces is `demo.txt` in the demo working directory; the walkthroughs in
[`../demos/`](../demos/) are the in-repo equivalents.

Two things the status column is deliberately blunt about:

- **Phase 3 is partial.** §9's steps 1-4 plus T5 are in the tree, but `EB_TENANCY_MODE` still
  defaults to `single`, which reproduces Phase 2 exactly. Owner-scoped reads, transcript auth,
  ntfy isolation, triggers and Kafka ACLs are design only.
- **Phase 4 is unimplemented.** Only §2 is measured; everything else depends on Phase 3's ntfy
  isolation and capability key landing first.

Phase 2 §8 additionally records thirteen control claims that a docs review found do not hold in
the code, and §8.5-§8.8 the five questions to ask of any control claim before it ships. That
procedure applies to every phase, not just Phase 2.

## What a spec is (and isn't)

|                | Spec (here)                                         | ADR ([`../adrs/`](../adrs/))        | Report ([`../reports/`](../reports/)) | Plan ([`../plans/`](../plans/)) |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Answers        | _what & why, in depth_                              | _one decision & its consequences_   | _what was built and measured_         | _how, in what order_            |
| Written        | **before** the code                                 | when the decision is taken          | **after** the phase lands             | before the code                 |
| Size           | long (a whole design)                               | short (one decision)                | long (measurements + findings)        | a checklist                     |
| On being wrong | **edit it**, bump the version, log the correction   | write a **new** ADR that supersedes | **append** — never rewrite            | delete it                       |
| Retention      | committed, living                                   | committed, permanent, immutable     | committed, append-only                | **local-only, gitignored**      |

A spec is **revised in place.** Unlike an ADR, it is meant to stay true: when the
implementation teaches you something, correct the spec and record what changed in the version
changelog. A reader opening the current spec should be able to trust it.

That is also why a spec is _not_ the place for measured results. Numbers from an actual run
go in a [report](../reports/), which is never rewritten — see
[the lifecycle note](../README.md#specs-revise-reports-do-not).

## Required header

Every spec opens with this block:

```markdown
# <Title> — Design

Version: 1.0 — <Month Year>
Status: Proposed
Milestone: **<ID>**, registered in [the registry](README.md)
Builds on (reuse, no redesign): <ID> (`<file>.md`) (<one line on what is reused>)
Report: `../reports/<topic>-report.md`  <!-- once it exists -->

> **The one-sentence thesis.** <The whole design in one sentence. If you cannot write it,
> the design is not settled yet.>
```

CI fails a spec missing `Version:` or `Status:`.

### The version changelog

Once a spec has been corrected, the `Version:` line carries its own history, and each set of
corrections gets a numbered subsection:

```markdown
Version: 1.3 — <Month Year> (v1.1: corrections from the implementation plan;
v1.2: corrections from the implementation and its review; v1.3: corrections from PR 2)

### 0.1 v1.1 corrections

1. **<What was wrong, stated as the correction.>** <Why the original was wrong.>
```

Write the correction as the _new_ fact, not as "we said X but actually Y" — the reader wants
the current truth first, the history second.

## Recommended shape

Beyond the header, specs in this repo tend to carry:

- **`## 0. Decisions taken during design`** — a two-column table of
  _question_ → _decision, with the rejected options named_. This is the highest-value section
  in the document and the one reviewers read first. Name what you turned down and why; a
  decision with no rejected alternative was not a decision.
- **The design proper** — numbered sections, so reviewers and later specs can cite `§4.2`.
- **`## N. What this does not do`** — the scope you are deliberately leaving out, and what
  would have to change to add it. Honest limits here prevent someone over-promising later.
- **`## N. Risks`** — what could still go wrong, and what would tell you it had.

## Creating one

```sh
cp docs/specs/0000-spec-template.md \
   docs/specs/$(date +%F)-<topic>-design.md
# fill in the header, write § 0 Decisions first, then the design
# add a row to the Index above
```
