"""The §16 four-stage demo flow, asserted rather than narrated. Tasks T5.3-T5.7.

    stage 0   idle at zero          minReplicaCount: 0
    stage 1   a task event wakes the agent
    stage 2   the agent runs and streams events
    stage 2b  /continue on a WARM pod resumes the same session
    stage 2c  /continue after a FULL scale-to-zero cycle also resumes  <- Gap B
    stage 3   back to zero when idle

Stages 2c and 3 are the point. Without them the demo works on the day it is built
and fails a week later, which is the worst possible failure mode for something
whose entire purpose is sitting idle at zero.

On `--overlay kind-signed` two more run (eventing-lab#2), which are the talk's D2 beat and the
one the abstract cannot back without them:

    signed wake        the terminal response carried a signature that VERIFIED, on a
                       cluster — produced by a runner pod from a Secret-mounted seed and
                       checked by a bridge pod against a ConfigMap keyset
    forgery refused    a throwaway pod publishes a correctly-encoded but UNSIGNED
                       terminal and group.completed onto the responses topic; the batch
                       does not settle, the genuine answer survives, and the attempt is
                       on record
    request refused    the same attack in the OTHER direction: an unsigned request is
                       injected onto the REQUESTS topic. This is the beat the abstract
                       names ("the broker hands off events before signature check") and
                       it is a different topic and direction from the forgery above —
                       that one forges an answer, this one forges the work itself.
                       Neither substitutes for the other
    audit trail        the topic read back with `audit_topic.py --chains`: which events
                       are signed, and which result answers which signed wake event.
                       Run AFTER both forgeries on purpose — an audit that showed a clean
                       topic after an attack would be worse than no audit

  python3 scripts/k8s_demo_flow.py                         # mock mode, free
  python3 scripts/k8s_demo_flow.py --overlay kind-signed   # + the signed beats
  python3 scripts/k8s_demo_flow.py --overlay demo          # real claude
  python3 scripts/k8s_demo_flow.py --skip-idle-replay
  python3 scripts/k8s_demo_flow.py --skip-cold-continue   # faster, skips 2c

Boundary to state out loud when demoing: the AGENT scales to zero, not the whole
system. EventBridge stays at one replica — something has to accept the POST and
hold the event store (§8.6). The claim is "no agent capacity is consumed while
idle", not "nothing is running".
